This work explores the strategy of assembling the optimal Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team for the entire season without making any in-season transfers. Fantasy Premier League is a strategic game where participants, known as managers, select real-life soccer players whose performances in actual matches dictate the manager's weekly score.

The game parallels the English Premier League, covering 38 gameweeks. Initially, managers can make unlimited adjustments to their teams until the commencement of the first gameweek. While typically managers are allowed one penalty-free transfer per week, this study investigates the effectiveness of a "set-and-forget" approach, humorously termed a "Zombie Team."

The goal is to determine the ideal "Zombie Team" setup that would achieve the highest total score across the season without any transfers. This involves carefully selecting players based on anticipated performance while adhering to the game's constraints:

Each FPL squad comprises 15 players, but only the 11 players selected to "start" each gameweek contribute to the score. Managers must consider the following constraints when forming their teams:

1. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of all players must not exceed Â£100 million.
2. **Team Constraint**: No more than three players from any single real-life Premier League team can be included.
3. **Position Constraints**: The squad must include 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders, and 3 forwards. Each gameweek's starting lineup must consist of exactly 1 goalkeeper, 3-5 defenders, 2-5 midfielders, and at least 1 forward.

This analysis aims to construct the most effective untouched team, providing valuable insights for FPL managers into strategic player selection.
